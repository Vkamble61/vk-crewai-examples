                <h2>Type 1 diabetes reversed in landmark study, paving the way for human trials</h2>
                <p>A groundbreaking study from Stanford School of Medicine revealed a potential cure for Type 1 diabetes in mice. Researchers reset the immune system and created new insulin-producing cells, curing all 19 pre-diabetic mice involved. This innovative approach could lead to revolutionary treatments for autoimmune diseases in humans.</p>
                <p>This finding not only opens the door for potential cures for autoimmune diseases in humans but also offers hope to millions with Type 1 diabetes for a future without dependence on insulin therapy.</p>
